 * Problem Description
 * 
 * 
 * Question:- There are n houses build in a line,
 * each of which contains some housesue in it.
 * 
 * 
 * A thief is going to steal the
 * maximal housesue of these houses, but he canâ€™t steal in two adjacent houses
 * because the owner of the stolen houses will tell his two neighbours left and
 * right side.
 * 
 * 
 * What is the maximum stolen housesue?
 * 
 * 
 * Sample Input: houses[] = {6, 7, 1, 3, 8, 2, 5}
 * 
 * 
 * Sample Output: 20
